# About Me
Iâ€™m currently a digital marketer focused on pivoting my career to focus on web and app development. Having worked in several industries, such as gaming and financial services, has enabled me to quickly adapt to different working environments. I'm looking for a role that marries my abilities to think creatively and analytically.
